# P4: Final Report and Presentation

## Introduction

Our project was to create an application for a farmer’s market. This project allowed us to in depth explore the rather unique shopping environment that is a farmer’s market, and attempt to come up with some solutions to make the experience better for all parties involved. 

The first thing that we did was to identify who the major stakeholders were for this project. We discovered that the major stakeholder in a project such as this would be the owner/operator of the farmer’s market we were building the application for. They would have the most to gain from a successful implementation of our app. Other stakeholders that would find value in our app would be consumers who visit the farmer’s market, and the farmer’s themselves who are selling things at the market. 


## Design Problem

The initial design problem that we aimed to solve was to find a way to make the experience better for the consumer, and therefore bring more business to the farmer’s in the market. We set out with a few original ideas that we hoped to solve through this application. The first being that farmer’s generally do not have a way to advertise their product. We hoped that through this application we could provide an outlet to connect the farmers with their ideal consumers to streamline the process of getting a sale. The next problem that we hoped to solve was that of the general confusion that consumers feel when walking into a market. Everything is laid out seemingly at random and it can be overwhelming for first time visitors to the market. We hoped that our application could find a way to reduce that feeling consumers have about the market. Lastly, we hoped to find a way to turn a primarily cash only business into a credit/debit friendly one for ease of consumers. 

## User Research and Findings

The user research that was chose to do was split into 3 parts. The first being a simple observation of consumers and farmers in the market. We attended the Calgary Farmer’s Market for a day and confirmed some of our design problems as actual problems that were occurring. We found that many people were spending most of their time at the market just wandering around with no real direction. This is taking away from potential sales that otherwise could be happening if there existed some sort of map system. The next thing that the observation told us was that farmers were indeed struggling to gain the attention of potential consumers. They were yelling at people as they walked by to come to their stall to entice them to make a purchase. 

The next user research method that we used was to try the farmer’s market experience ourselves. In this case the goal was to find a produce stand and to purchase an apple using a credit card. This method revealed to us in greater detail what the average consumer was experiencing as well as enlightened us about the difficulties in using a credit card at the farmer’s market. The vendor that we attempted to purchase from was very hesitant to use the credit machine, even seeming unsure about how it worked, leaving us with valuable information about the need for an easier system for all parties involved. 
  
The last user research method that was used was to create a photo journal of the day. This allowed us to reflect in greater detail on the experience and see things in a different light that we otherwise would have missed. This method served to further confirm our decisions that the design problems we chose were the correct ones. 


## Design and Justification

The final design that we implemented could solve most of the design problems that we had originally laid out. In the final design an interactive map is present that, aside from showing the user exactly how the farmer’s market is laid out, will also provide valuable information about each vendor should it be selected. The information available comes directly from the vendor, providing not only a product list, but also a description of themselves, how their products are created and the information about each unique product. These two designs serve to solve the original design problems of users being overwhelmed by the market, and farmers being unable to advertise effectively. Through our app, users can gain knowledge about the market and the goods that they will see/want to purchase even before entering. This helps to streamline the entire experience on both ends which will create a much better environment for all the stakeholders that we originally identified. The only thing that was not implemented was a debit/credit system through the app itself, which proved to be too difficult to implement in this iteration. 

## Heuristic Evaluation and Findings

Our heuristic evaluation uncovered several things about our app that should be fixed in the future, to further improve the design that we have already laid out. The largest issue uncovered was that of the limited information given by the map itself. The heuristic of “Flexibility and efficiency of use” was violated here as there is much improvement for things on the map screen such as locations for bathrooms, entrances and exits, and things like ATMs. Another heuristic that we found to be violated was that of “Help and Documentation”. This was violated because there is little to no documentation about what the user is supposed to do. We relied on the user understanding symbols/having basic knowledge of how a system like this would work for it to function. This is incorrect and should be fixed to be more friendly to all users. The final violated heuristic that was important enough to touch on was that of “Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors”. This heuristic was violated because there is no error messages when a user searches for something that doesn’t exist. Instead the system will simply return the original state with no explanation about what went wrong.

## Recommendations for Next Iteration of Design

For the next iteration of our app there are 3 main things that we would like to see changed/improved upon. 
1)	The map. Specifically, we would like to improve on the information given to the user via the map. There are multiple upgrades that we can do to the map such as: adding in icons that represent locations of bathrooms, ATM machines, and entrances/exits. Another thing that we can add to the map would be icons on each of the vendors that could give the user some basic information before they press that vendor. An example would be to have a number of dollar signs on each vendor that represents how expensive they are compared to the other ones in their product class. 
2)	Another upgrade to our app for the next iteration would be to add in error messages and an instructions tab. The goal here would be to increase usability for all consumers, not just ones who understand technology. We would like to implement a specific page or a tutorial that could walk users through how to work our app whenever they needed help. Additionally, having helpful error messages will ensure that users have a pleasant experience with our app even when the app failed to provide them with what they are looking for (hence the error message)
3)	The last change that we would like to see done for the next iteration would be to add in functionality to the pay via app option. This would ideally work in two ways: first option would be for the user to pay via our app and pick up the product at the farmer’s market themselves. This eliminates all hassle on the farmers end as they have already been paid and just need to supply the product. The second option for our payment feature would be to order from the farmer and then they can ship to the users address. This eliminates the need for the farmer to have the item purchased in stock the minute it is purchased, and allows for larger than average purchases from the vendor that a consumer would otherwise not be able to carry out. 


## Conclusions

In conclusion, our application helps to solve several problems that we identified in the farmer’s market industry. It helps to create a better consumer experience through map, product information and eventually the ability to purchase through the app. It also helps to attract consumers to the vendor’s stalls which generates more revenue for them as well as generates more revenue for the owner of the market because farmer’s wish to come sell their products at their market. Our app increases the satisfaction of all of our stakeholders and successfully solves several design problems in farmer’s markets that were identified at the start of our project.
