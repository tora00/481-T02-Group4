# P2: Ideation and Lo-fi Prototypes

## Video Prototype

The video prototype illustrates the various functions of the application, which features a scenario where an end-user navigates through the app in order to find a specific product.

## Storyboard

The storyboard illustrates a specific task where a user goes through most of the features the application has (in this case, navigating the app to find vendors that sell corn). It starts out at the map of the market, the user, unaware of what the coloured stalls mean presses the legend button in order to identify what stall type correspond to the colour. She then presses the search button and searches for 'corn'. She hits search and the map updates to only show the stalls that sells corn. This is depicted by greying out all other unrelated stalls. The user picks a stall and the vendor's product list is shown, in this case, the first item listed is corn. Out of curiosity, she then presses the 'about' button to bring up the vendor's information, including their social media page.

However, all these steps are not necessarily required in order to complete the tasks as described in P1, as most of these steps are independent of each other (eg. the ability to select a stall is not dependent on the user searching for a vendor first).

## Task-Centered System Walkthrough

### Walkthrough of task 4 in Project 1  - Jamie purchasing a pair of moccasins.

#### Step 0 - Opening the app

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The application starts with a map of the farmer's market and two buttons - a search button on the bottom left corner, and a legend button on the bottom right corner.


#### Step 1 - Searching for shoes

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since Jamie is tech savvy, she is familiar with the concept of a search function and presses the search button on the bottom left corner. There are only 2 possible other functions from the main menu, an end-user won't need to worry about being overwhelmed by too many features. Since the most common icon for something someone wants to look for is a magnifying glass, it does not require a lot of technical knowledge to relate the two. However, the legend button may be confused for a search function or something akin to "show all shop names", the image can be modified to prevent any confusion. So it is believable for any user, especially Jamie, to immediately use the search function. 


#### Step 2 - Search bar input

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jamie types "moccasin" in the search box and presses search. The map updates and shows a single blue stall stationed at the bottom left of the map. The search page consists of a search box, search button, and a clear button. The page is intuitive and simple enough that most users won't think it's too convoluted to deter them from using it. The straight forward functions makes the page feel simplistic enough for this step to be believable, so this page won't need further design modifications.


#### Step 3 - Display list/End task

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jamie has the option to either walk to the store, ending the task, or access the product list of the vendor. Most users will more likely do the former if they prefer to check the products themselves. The latter can apply in some instances, such as if a user is searching for something specific and is already accessing the application prior to arriving at the market.


## Brainstorm and Affinity Diagram

The initial idea was a marketboard type of application where the advertisement of the shop is broadcasted at a screen and its contents can be modified through a phone app. This idea is to provide an alternative for physical signs. However, this idea is too costly in reality, and the impact is not significant enough to warrant a transition.

The next idea was a "Pokemon Go!" type of application where a user can tap on the floating boards of the shop to pull up information from the vendor or 'throw' market balls to purchase items from the shop. As fun and creative as this sounds, it isn't at all feasible to consider since the concept is too ludicrous and odd for shoppers to use.

The final idea we came up with, and stuck to, is a simple interactive map that simply shows the vendor information and their products when selected, and also features a simple search feature. While the concept isn't original, it is simple to use so vendors and shoppers alike can efficiently utilize the app with minimal technological knowledge. However, in this version, the search and legend buttons are not noticeable enough. To fix this, without adding too much clutter to the map, the functions are changed to buttons located at the bottom of the screen, offering ease of access while still maintaining a good coverage of the interactive map.


## Reflection

Looking back at the entirety of this ideation process we could identify several things that worked well for our group. The first being that we could bounce ideas off each other easily even if those ideas were strange at the time. For example, in class we came up with the idea of a delivery system for the farmer’s market using swallows (small, fast birds) to transport product to consumer’s houses. Another strange idea we had was that of a “pokemon go” type system that allowed people to wander through the market and using VR, would show them what type of product the vendor was selling on their phone. From these ideas, we could refine down to something more practical, while still solving the problems that the other two ideas attempted to. Another thing that worked well in our group was the environment that was created throughout this process. Never once did I feel as though any idea anyone had was looked down upon, and everything was considered equally throughout the entire process. Something that went poorly in our group though was that once we had a good idea in place, it was hard to consider anything else. We wanted to move forwards with the project immediately upon having a solid idea, rather than attempting to extrapolate our other ideas too. 


If we were to do this again, we would make sure to slow the whole process down. With this being a condensed course it was difficult to take our time, but hindsight being 20/20 it would have been beneficial to do so. We would consider all ideas equally and attempt to expand on all ideas before making a decision, rather than expanding on a few and deciding from there. Overall though, we feel that this ideation process went well and we could come up with a solid storyboard of an application that can solve many problems that someone would experience on a day to day level at a farmer’s market.
