## Project Idea

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our project is going to be a take on a farmer’s market application. To explain what this project aims to accomplish; first we must explain the needs that we have discovered in a farmer’s market as well as the concept behind how a farmer’s market works.

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A farmer’s market is a place in which local farmers go to sell their produce or other items directly to the consumer. It is through these that farmer’s attempt to cut out the middle man and sell to the consumers themselves. This is beneficial to both parties because the consumers get the freshest products available to them, and the farmers will make a little more money due to not having to sell to a distributor at wholesale prices. From this, we found that there are a few issues with the way that the current setup is done and believe that our application can help fix these. Firstly: farmer’s markets tend to be very confusing and a literal labyrinth of food and assorted other items. This makes it difficult for consumers to easily find the things that they are looking for and therefore cuts into the farmer’s profits since their customers cannot easily find them in the market. This can be solved easily by having either a map system for the market, or allowing farmers to advertise on the application exactly where they are located. Another way in which we can see our application being used is by allowing farmers to store certain information on this application. We would allow for farmers to keep accurate measurements of their products quantity, when it was picked, etc. This is important because consumers are very keen on knowing this information and the nutritional value of the products as well as wanting only the freshest products. The last problem that we hope our application can solve is that of farmer’s markets traditionally being a cash only business. Our application would allow for credit card purchases in addition to the cash business that is currently run. In summary: Our application would primarily cater to the farmer’s themselves by allowing them to advertise their location in the market, store product information easily, and make selling product much more user friendly for all parties.
