## Highlight Walkthrough

### Vendor Search Function

Starting from the main menu of the application, pressing the search button at the centre bottom of the screen transitions to the search page.

An input field and two buttons are shown on the search page. Search will update the map so it will only show matching queries. Clear quickly erases any text in the input field. Searching without any input defaults to all vendors being avaialable on the map.

### Vendor Information Function

Starting from the main page of the application, pressing any stall will transition to the information page of the selected vendor.

The vendor information page shows various information about the vendor - name, description of the vendor, a link to the products page, and links to their social media pages. Back and map buttons on the top area also available in case the user wants to transition to either the previous page or the main page.


### Vendor Products Function

Starting from the vendor page, a products list button can be accessed to view all the products the vendor is selling.

Pressing on a product icon will transition to the selected product page, which shows information about the product, such as price and description. There is also a purchase item button that allows the user to purchase the item on mobile.

Going back to the products list page, there is also a search function feature that filters out the list of products according to the input. The list then updates if matching searches are found.

## Heuristic Evaluation Results

| Heuristic Violated | Problem | Solution | How Major? (Scale 1-5) |
| ------------------ | ------- | -------- | ---------------------- |
| Flexibility and efficiency of use | The main menu is vague, no marked enterances or exits, no atms/bathrooms etc. There is room for improvement on the scope shown in the map |	In a future iteration I would add in locations of exits, bathrooms, and atms all onto the map portion to give the user even more information about the market |	5
| Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors |	There is not any error messages for when a user does something wrong, the system just does not return the correct value |	In a future iteration of this project I would add in messages to the user to guide them when they are doing something wrong |	4
| Error prevention |	There is no documentation about how the purchasing feature is supposed to work |	In a future iteration I would add in Info about the purchasing feature and how to buy an item then pick it up at the vendor |	4
| Help and Documentation | The system does not guide the user on what to do, rather it is expected that they understand basic symbols such as search |	In a future iteration I would add in a help section to show the user the basics of the system so they can navigate with ease | 3
| Flexibility and efficiency of use |	The main menu of the system is not super clear as to what is going on or what vendor is which |	In future it would be wise to add in some symbols on each vendor to show what they represent, or allow the vendors to be sorted somehow (price point or some other metric) |	3
| User Control and Freedom |	After searching for either a vendor or a product, there is no clear way to ‘clear’ the searches. The user would have to re-access the search functions and update it manually. |	Implement a tool on modified pages (eg. Updated map, products list) that easily removes the modifying conditions |	3
| Error prevention |	Do not let the user search for nothing |	I would institute error popups for simple errors like this, noone ever means to search for nothing |	2
| Flexibility and efficiency of use |	The links to social media open up a whole new page for the social media rather than simply opening up a tab of it on the app itself |	I would make sure that the app doesn’t effectively close itself when opening the social media pages for ease of the user transitioning between the two |	2
| Consistency and Standards |	Back and Map buttons do the same function at some point in the application. Ie. Going back from a vendor page leads to a map, which the map button does as well |	Remove map button on pages where back button leads back to the map |	2
| Consistency and Standards |	The search bar for the menu is located at the top of the screen but the search bar for the products of individual vendors is on the bottom |	Align these for consistancy sake for the users |	1
