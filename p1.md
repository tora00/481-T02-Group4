# P1: User Research

## Project Idea

  Our project is going to be a take on a farmer’s market application. To explain what this project aims to accomplish; first we must explain the needs that we have discovered in a farmer’s market as well as the concept behind how a farmer’s market works.

  A farmer’s market is a place in which local farmers go to sell their produce or other items directly to the consumer. It is through these that farmer’s attempt to cut out the middle man and sell to the consumers themselves. This is beneficial to both parties because the consumers get the freshest products available to them, and the farmers will make a little more money due to not having to sell to a distributor at wholesale prices. From this, we found that there are a few issues with the way that the current setup is done and believe that our application can help fix these. Firstly: farmer’s markets tend to be very confusing and a literal labyrinth of food and assorted other items. This makes it difficult for consumers to easily find the things that they are looking for and therefore cuts into the farmer’s profits since their customers cannot easily find them in the market. This can be solved easily by having either a map system for the market, or allowing farmers to advertise on the application exactly where they are located. Another way in which we can see our application being used is by allowing farmers to store certain information on this application. We would allow for farmers to keep accurate measurements of their products quantity, when it was picked, etc. This is important because consumers are very keen on knowing this information and the nutritional value of the products as well as wanting only the freshest products. The last problem that we hope our application can solve is that of farmer’s markets traditionally being a cash only business. Our application would allow for credit card purchases in addition to the cash business that is currently run. In summary: Our application would primarily cater to the farmer’s themselves by allowing them to advertise their location in the market, store product information easily, and make selling product much more user friendly for all parties.

## Stakeholders and Users

•	The Farmers: Farmers are a stakeholder in this application because it is designed with them in mind. The entirety of this application is created to solve everyday problems that these farmers at the market will experience. The 3 main points of our application serve to make the farmer’s lives easier from start of the experience to the end. Marketing-selling-consumer purchasing are all features that this application would have. 
•	Consumers: Consumers are a stakeholder in this application as it also serves to make their experience much more favorable. The application will allow them to find the farmer/product that they are searching for more easily, as well as give them information about the product that wouldn’t readily be available otherwise, and make purchasing the products much more convenient. 
•	Owners of Farmer’s Market: The people who own/run the farmer’s market are stakeholders because this application would ideally bring more farmer’s/consumers to the market. The owners theoretically make money on all the farmer’s that attend the market. Therefore; more people attending due to this application would make for more money for the owners.  


## User Research Methods
• Observation
    We chose observation as one of our research methods because it allows an unfiltered view of how a farmers market is run on a day to day basis. It also allows to view interactions between the two stakeholders, farmers and consumers.
    
• Try it yourself
    We participated in the farmers market as a consumer in order to experience the actual interaction that consumers and farmers participate in on a daily basis. Since they (farmers) did not have any knowledge of this project, it forces them to be unbiased towards us and treat us as a usual customer.

• Camera Journal
    It allows us to see the environment again after we leave, noticing other potentially important cues that we may have missed. Having photos also opens the scene to a variety of interpretations that could influence how the app may be developed.

### Observation: ...

\<Add photo here\>

Above is a photo of our notes when we visited a farmer's  market. As you can see, observation allowed us to record things we wouldn't have thought of before and would help with creating other beneficial aspects of the application.

"This is confusing.. everything is laid out everywhere.."
  This tells us that there is a small lack of organization when it comes to what stall is selling what type of product. It also implies that there is some need for a map in order to nagivate the market better, if realigning the stalls is not an option.

".. Cash only on most places which is super inconvenient.."
  Since most farmers are older people, they are not inclined to use technology to initiate transactions (eg. debit) because of how it may be too complicated for them to utilize.

### Try it Yourself: ...

The experience that we had during the "try it yourself" method was interesting to say the least. We attempted to purchase 3 apples froma vendor that was selling produce. The selection and ease of getting the products was great and I personally was wondering why people do not attend farmer's markets all of the time. I noticed that the cashier actually had a debit machine, which had been a rarity thus far, so I asked if she would accept debit. The older lady behind the till actually sighed at me. She sighed and said "I guess so" in a tone that left the impression that debit/credit was new here and the older generation of farmers were reluctant to use it. This method and experience lead to our decision for this application to contain some sort of credit system that would be fool proof for the elderly/less technically inclined people to use. We want to continue to have the ease of credit card payments, but if we could find a way to add into our application a way to make it even easier for the farmers that would be ideal.

### Reflections on User Research

  Observation and try it yourself methods are the best methods to use given the time constraints, since it does not take any time to set up while still getting relevant information. However, while the former provides a third person view of the interactions, it is prone to bias on our end since we are looking for people struggling with things that we can possible improve on. The latter's downside is also prone to a small bias since we are more technically inclined to use transaction machines, other customers may not possess the same abilities and would strongly prefer traditional transactions.
  
  However, we would not choose to do anything differently given the nature of our application and time constrictions, we believe these are the better methods we can employ.

## Task Descriptions

  1 - Jill is a farmer and she wants to sell her apple. However, less and less people are using cash these days, and she can't figure out how to use the debit machine. She wants to be able to accept credit card purchases in order to make more money for her farm.
    
• Using our application, Jill would be able to accept credit card payment with little to no work on her part.
  
  2 - Paul is a tech-savvy hipster farmer, looking to advertise his non-GMO 100% Organic grapes grown in the hills of Sicily. He's realized that his location in the farmer's market doesn't receive as much traffic as other grape sellers near the entraces. He wishes to increase his traffic via some sort of advertising.
  
• Using our application, Paul could advertise his non-GMO grapes using the application's map features so customers would be easily able to find him.
    
  3 - Lorenzo is a farmer with many different crops. So many that he is having a hard time keeping track of the crops' information, such as harvest dates, dates to ripen, and nutritional value. He needs a way to keep track of all these information, while still being able to modify it when needed.
  
• Using our application, Lorenzo is able to accurately store all of his crop information in the app's database and add or modify additional descriptions on his crops.
    
  4 - Jamie is visiting a Farmer's market for the first time looking to purchase a pair of moccasins. She realizes that there is no map of where the relevant vendors are stationed in. She is a moderately savvy tech user and would like a way to navigate the market with relative ease.
  
• Using our application, Jamie can use its interactive map feature to quickly find vendors that sell moccasins.
    
  5 - Lisa is a picky shopper and only buys non-GMO, 100% organic, gluten-free, free-ranged celery. She usually has a hard time finding the right vendors, walking around the market the whole day. While she uses technology to upload her instagram photos, she wants an app with a user-friendly interface that can help her find specific shops.
  
• Using our application, Lisa will be easily able to find her shops using its search feature. Since the application is a 'simple' interactive map, there is not a lot of clutter and users will find it easy to navigate.
    
  6 - Calvin is a first time visitor to the farmer's market and consequently doesn't carry cash with him. He prefers to pay with a debit or credit card, but most vendors are unable or unwilling to accept either payment types. He wishes for a simpler way to purchase goods rather than carry a wallet full of cash.
  
 • Using our application, vendors will have the option to a one-time credit card payment setup so they would not have to manually handle a debit/credit machine for each transaction. This in turn will allow Calvin to be cash-free and be able to pay wirelessly with his credit card.
